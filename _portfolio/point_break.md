As the [Museum of Modern Art notes](https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_press-release_387231.pdf):

> This kinetic thrill ride cements adrenalized set pieces—shoot-outs, chases on foot, birds-eye-view skydiving—with a surf-culture Zen spirituality that lives by the maxim of carpe diem. Point Break‘s hyperrealism, a trademark of Bigelow’s filmmaking, draws audiences into her specific subjectivity, allowing them to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride.

Point Break also the distinction of being one of the first movies to have a stage adaptation created out of it that broke new theater ground as the first-ever [“reality play.”](www.pointbreaklive.com)

========================

Gotta have meatball subs with the movie.

There are a variety of Point Break drinking game options; one set of rules that has worked well (many times) in the past is the following.

Drink when:
1. Someone says Utah
2. Someone says "brah"
3. Someone dies
4. There's surfing
5. Adrenaline or the rush is mentioned
6. The Ex-President masks are worn
7. There's a fight

Finish your beer whenever someone jumps out of a plane without a parachute

Extra drinks for select memorable quotes/instances (or at host's discretion):
1. Young, dumb, full of cum
2. Keanu fires his gun into the air
3. "I am an FBI agent!"
