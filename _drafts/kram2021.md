KRAM 2021: How Keanu got his oeuvre back
=================================

The Keanussaince remains alive and well. After what some might consider a midcareer lull in late 2000s, Keanu's celebrity is again shining bright. Now in his mid-fifties (56, to be exact), he has build up an impressive body of work that is ripe for interrogation.

This year's course considers the question "what single Keanu film best captures his [oeuvre](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre)?", at least in terms of his cinematic / public persona (for who can really know another man's soul, etc etc). I posit the thesis that, despite coming early in his career, *Point Break* most typifies Keanu's oeuvre. We will examine the thesis by studying films that support the thesis, those that do not, and others that fall in a middle ground. Our investigation into many of the major themes / films with common thematic elements of Keanu's career will also set the stage for deeper dives into specific aspects of Keanu's repertoire as part of future KRAMs.

As last year, KRAM 2021 is being offered as a course that can be taken both pass/fail and for a letter grade, though the grading scale has been updated.

# Course Syllabus
-------------
[*pdf version*](../files/Syllabus_KRAM2021.pdf)


**Course Instructor: Dr. Michael Walker**

**Email: mayiskram@gmail.com**

**Course Dates: May 1 - May 31, 2021**

*Note: COVID-19 remains a challenge, and this is meant to be fun for all. Any participation that you can make is encouraged, there's no add/drop deadline, and I anticipate a generous grading curve.*

**Course structure:** This is an online course. The basic structure is a set of 2 weekly films selected for synchronous viewing (though these can also be watched asynchronously with no effect on one's grade):
 - Saturday night (usually 7:30/8pm PT start): films more directly in support of the thesis
 - Midweek (Wednesday or Thursday night, around 8pm PT start): films that complicate, or provide a more nuanced interpretation, to the main thesis.

We will also be setting at least one Sunday matinee feature, in order to help accommodate participation by those not on the West Coast, and additional office hours / happy hours can be scheduled by reaching out to the instructor.


**Grading:**
*All grading is on the basis of engagement with the course material (i.e. watching Keanu movies).* For each movie watched, students should submit a very brief (1-2 sentences, though longer also accepted) review and movie rating for films that they watch through this [submission portal](https://forms.gle/otLVgpLh8xPLPUdUA).
*I will be tracking credit based on reviews submitted through the portal -- if you don't submit a review, you won't get credit!*

Grading basis options:
 - *Pass/Fail option:* Students must watch at least 1 Keanu movie during the month of May 2021 in order to pass the course.
 - *Letter grade option:* Students may earn points through the following ways:
   - Each Keanu movie watched: 1 point each
   - Watching Point Break: 2 additional points (I was originally thinking of this as a one-time bonus, but if you want to repeatedly watch Point Break throughout the month I'm not going to discourage that)
   - Term "paper": up to 5 points -- this is at least 1 paragraph laying out your agreement / disagreement with the central thesis of the course, backed by supporting evidence from the films that we have watched.


While I reserve all rights to adjust the grading basis as I see fit, the following is a rough sense of how I am thinking about grade allocations:
 - A+: 13 or more points
 - A: 9 - 12 points
 - A-: 4 - 8 points
 - B+: 3 points
 - B: 2 points
 - The gentleman's B-: 1 point


The instructor reserves the right to unilaterally adjust grading bases to one more advantageous to the student.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Course Outline</span>**

## Weekend 1 (May 1): Quarterback Keanu

**[The Replacements](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-replacements)**

Ah, quarterback, that All-American of positions. Johnny Utah got a football scholarship to law school (still unclear how that works). We'll see how another All-American name (Shane Falco) fares!


Bonus watches:
1. Keanu plays hockey! [Youngblood](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/youngblood-1986) -- may not be available to stream
2. Keanu coaches baseball! [Hardball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180734/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_53)
2. Keanu is in academia! [Chain Reaction](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115857/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_64)

## Midweek 1: Period costume Keanu  

I am still not yet ready to count the early 90s outfits as period costumes, so this set of films goes against the grain. As the set of films for which Keanu dons old-timey garb is noticeably smaller than his contemporary and sci-fi films,

**[Bram Stoker's Dracula](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/dracula-1992)

Dracula is also an excellent example of a film that can complicate simple thematic
As Jonathan Harker, Keanu plays a barrister, which directly ties into Weekend 2 in support of the Point Break thesis, and the religious themes


Bonus options:
1. [Much Ado about Nothing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107616/)
2. [A Walk in the Clouds](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114887/)


## Weekend 2 (May 8): Lawyer Keanu

**Dogstar Song of the Week:** [Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLwZvvxwLxw) (definitely a historical dude, though sadly no cameo)

**Midweek Flick:** Keep the early Keanu vibes going, but change up the feel! Choose either art-house or gritty instead of buddy comedy:

1. [My Own Private Idaho](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102494/)
2. [River’s Edge](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/)

1. [Always Be My Maybe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7374948/) - the most amazing Keanu cameo of all time. When I heard there was a Keanu cameo, I was excited but kept expectations low so as not to be disappointed. They were exceeded beyond all expectations. Instant KRAM classic. Plus San Francisco!
2. [Sweet November](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230838/) - workaholic Keanu needs to become more spontaneous and zen, as in Point Break
3. [The Lake House](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410297/) - reprising two of Keanu’s favorite things, time travel and Sandra Bullock!
4. [Destination Wedding](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6987770/) - perhaps the most awkward sex scene ever put to film, plus learn how to scare off cougars (the animal, not older women. Check out Keanu in [Something’s Gotta Give](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337741/) for more on that)

2. Choose another movie from weekend 3 or weekend 4.

**Weekend 4 (May 22-25): Keanu knows G/Kung-Fu**

_Memorial Day weekend provides an extra opportunity to go deep on action Keanu. While this gives more of a highlight-reel, feel free to dive into sequels and tre-quels._

**Extra/ Substitute Weekend: Keanu deals with the Devil:**

1. [The Devil’s Advocate](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118971/)
2. [Constantine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/)
3. [Dracula](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103874/)* (not quite the Devil, but close enough)

**_Alternate option: Keanu is a lawyer!_** Substitute

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Additional Course Notes</span>**

**Some general advice:** it’s always nice to see some new movies. Keanu has been in enough films there’s usually always something new that can be brought in. If you’re looking for something new beyond the films listed here:

*   : saw this for the first time in May last year. Really builds on Keanu’s implausible educational history from Point Break (football scholarship to law school). Here, Keanu was getting a PhD in physics but after doing experiments in his apartment and causing an explosion, he now works as a machinist for a green energy lab and makes a key discovery that leads to the discovery of a new green energy technology. But then he’s framed for an explosion and has to go on the run. Also featuring Morgan Freeman and Rachel Weisz.
*   [Day the Earth Stood Still](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970416/): [some have said this is the perfect role for Keanu](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2394677/?ref_=tt_urv)
*   [Thumbsucker](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318761/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_45)
