# And now: reflections
May has always been a special month for me. Historically, it has been a time of celebrating the labor movement, mothers, and Memorial Day. In areas with seasons, it marks consistently warmer weather, and flowers from all those showers.
(While researching this reflection, I also learned that May contains [National Homebrew Day (first Saturday)](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-homebrew-day-first-saturday-in-may/), [National Craft Distillery Day (5/22)](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-craft-distillery-day-may-22/), [National Wine Day (5/25)](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/days-2/national-wine-day-may-25/), and [National Utah Day (5/31 - I can only assume they mean Johnny )](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-utah-day-may-31/))

But it's also very personally meaningful, especially this year. It marks a decade since my wife and I first made out (thanks Kentucky Derby party), and 5 years since we've been married. Our daughter was born during the month of February. And since 2006, there has always been KRAM to look forward to. It really means a lot that all of you have come together with me so many times to watch these movies and to celebrate. The level of enthusiasm this year has been great to see, and keep the messages and reviews coming!

I am excited for all that is going to happen this month.
