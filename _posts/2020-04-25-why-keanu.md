We've all gotten the question (Haven't we?): why Keanu? Of all the actors that you could imagine dedicating a month to year after year, what makes him so special?

The main thing I can say is that I just keep coming back to his movies. The range and versatility -- comedy, drama, action. Iconic characters: Johnny Utah, Neo, John Wick, chocolate salesman. And (for better or worse) there's a degree of consistency in his performances, no matter the genre. He really commits, and in this day and age, that's saying something.

Plus, Dogstar! C'mon!
