Keanu comes back home (to SF, no less) to his wife Debra Messing, and then takes to the road again as a traveling chocolate salesman. On a bus towards Napa, he finds a woman crying, because she is unmarried and pregnant and her conservative family will disown her. Keanu comes up with the *brilliant* plan to pretend to be her husband, then leave her, so the family will be mad at him and not her. What a guy! What on earth could happen next? There's no way they might actually fall in love, right?

Watch to find out!

"Better than I remembered but still a ridiculous movie that goes out of its way to avoid any dramatic tension."

"Zero indigenous Aztecs married into this family."

"The grape crushing dance was very sensuous, but watch out for the sheets!"
