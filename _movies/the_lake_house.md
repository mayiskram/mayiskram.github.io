## Selected KRAM reviews/comments

"Keanu Reeves wears multiple ribbed turtlenecks and several handsome brown jackets."

"We don’t even get a full tour of the titular house. Show us your closets, Keanu! We are guests in your home! Where is this magical attic?"

"The Lake House is like the TV show “Lost” without the first 3 seasons of excitement and anticipation that maybe there’d be a big reveal where all the plot lines made sense. The Lake House’s preposterously-stitched time warp has, instead, all of the confusion and bewilderment of Jon Snow going north of the Wall to capture a White Walker with none of the nudity to look forward to. I think The Lake House was rated PG, which I honestly forgot was an option. At least I wasn’t stoned when I watched it, because if I was I’d have no doubt blown another 120 minutes re-watching it to see if the time travel stuff actually made sense if viewed with ones wits intact."
