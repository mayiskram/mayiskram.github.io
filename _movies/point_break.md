As the [Museum of Modern Art notes](https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_press-release_387231.pdf):

> This kinetic thrill ride cements adrenalized set pieces—shoot-outs, chases on foot, birds-eye-view skydiving—with a surf-culture Zen spirituality that lives by the maxim of carpe diem. Point Break‘s hyperrealism, a trademark of Bigelow’s filmmaking, draws audiences into her specific subjectivity, allowing them to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride.
