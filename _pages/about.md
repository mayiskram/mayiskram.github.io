Well before the Keanussance, a group of friends came to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves was not being adequately appreciated by the world at-large. So in 2006, they declared that henceforth, the month of May would forever be:

# Keanu Reeves Appreciation Month (KRAM)

Fast-forward more than a decade. Keanu now seems to get the public adulation that he deserves, yet that does not diminish the joy of celebrating him each May.

Why Keanu? [I'm so glad you asked!](/posts/why_keanu/)

*Please, come join us on this journey.*

KRAM (hugs in Swedish)!
