KRAM 2021: How Keanu got his oeuvre back
=================================

*Jump to [course schedule](#schedule)*

The Keanussaince remains alive and well. After what some might consider a midcareer lull in late 2000s, Keanu's celebrity is again shining bright. Now in his mid-fifties (56, to be exact), he has build up an impressive body of work that is ripe for interrogation.

This year's course considers the question "what single Keanu film best captures his [oeuvre](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oeuvre)?", at least in terms of his cinematic / public persona (for who can really know another man's soul, etc etc). I posit that, despite coming early in his career, *Point Break* most typifies Keanu's oeuvre. We will examine this thesis by studying films that support the thesis, those that do not, and others that fall in a middle ground. We will also investigate similarities and differences in the themes between early and later Keanu films: did Keanu's oeuvre change, thus precipitating the Keanussaince, or has Keanu remained the same while the world changed, finally leading to the appreciation he deserves?

Our investigation into many of the major themes / films with common thematic elements of Keanu's career will also set the stage for deeper dives into specific aspects of Keanu's repertoire as part of future KRAMs.

As last year, KRAM 2021 is being offered as a course that can be taken both pass/fail and for a letter grade, though the grading scale has been updated.


**To register for the course, please complete the following [registration form](https://forms.gle/Zq3uFaaBcMqLNbZ66).** (This will put you on the list for future emails and course updates).



**Course structure**

*Note: COVID-19 remains a challenge, and this is meant to be fun for all. Any participation that you can make is encouraged, there's no add/drop deadline, and I anticipate a generous grading curve.*

This is an online course. The basic structure is a set of 2 weekly films selected for synchronous viewing (though these can also be watched asynchronously with no effect on one's grade):
 - Saturday night (usually 7:30/8pm PT start): films more directly in support of the thesis
 - Midweek (Wednesday or Thursday night, around 8pm PT start): films that complicate, or provide a more nuanced interpretation, to the main thesis.

Additional office hours / happy hours can be scheduled by reaching out to the instructor.


**Grading**

*All grading is on the basis of engagement with the course material (i.e. watching Keanu movies).* For each movie watched, students should submit a very brief (1-2 sentences, though longer also accepted) review and movie rating for films that they watch through this [submission portal](https://forms.gle/otLVgpLh8xPLPUdUA).
*I will be tracking credit based on reviews submitted through the portal -- if you don't submit a review, you won't get credit!*

Grading basis options:
 - *Pass/Fail option:* Students must watch at least 1 Keanu movie during the month of May 2021 in order to pass the course.
 - *Letter grade option:* Students may earn points through the following ways:
   - Each Keanu movie watched: 1 point each
   - Watching Point Break: 2 additional points (I was originally thinking of this as a one-time bonus, but if you want to repeatedly watch Point Break throughout the month I'm not going to discourage that)
   - Term "paper": up to 5 points -- this is at least 1 paragraph laying out your agreement / disagreement with the central thesis of the course, backed by supporting evidence from the films that we have watched.


While I reserve all rights to adjust the grading basis as I see fit, the following is a rough sense of how I am thinking about grade allocations:
 - A+: 13 or more points
 - A: 9 - 12 points
 - A-: 4 - 8 points
 - B+: 3 points
 - B: 2 points
 - The gentleman's B-: 1 point


The instructor reserves the right to unilaterally adjust grading bases to one more advantageous to the student.

# Schedule

*This is subject to change*

**Weekend 1 (May 1): Quarterback Keanu**

**Movie: [The Replacements](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-replacements)**

Ah, quarterback, that All-American of positions. Johnny Utah got a football scholarship to law school (still unclear how that works). We'll see how another All-American name (Shane Falco) fares!


Bonus watches:
1. Keanu plays hockey! [Youngblood](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/youngblood-1986) -- may not be available to stream
2. Keanu coaches baseball! [Hardball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180734/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_53)
2. Keanu is in academia! [Chain Reaction](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115857/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_64)

**Midweek 1: Period costume Keanu**

I am still not yet ready to count the early 90s outfits as period costumes, so this set of films goes against the grain. As the set of films for which Keanu dons old-timey garb is noticeably smaller than his contemporary and sci-fi films, this feels less central to his oeuvre.

**Movie: [Bram Stoker's Dracula](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/dracula-1992)**

Dracula is also an excellent example of a film that can complicate simple thematic
As Jonathan Harker, Keanu plays a barrister, which directly ties into Weekend 2 in support of the Point Break thesis, and opens the door to the religious themes present in many of Keanu's films.


Bonus options:
1. [Much Ado about Nothing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107616/)
2. [A Walk in the Clouds](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114887/)
3. [Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/bill-and-teds-excellent-adventure) (though not much costume-wearing on Keanu's part)


**Weekend 2 (May 8): Lawyer Keanu**

Again, law school on a football scholarship, into a job at the EFFF-BEEE-IIII.

**Movie: [The Devil's Advocate](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-devils-advocate)**


Bonus option: [The Whole Truth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3503406/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_25) -- Keanu does more lawyer-ing


**Midweek 2: Religious Icon Keanu**

In addition to the religious themes that we have already seen in some of Keanu's films, sometimes Keanu IS the religious icon. We see that clearly in:

**Movie: [Little Buddha](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/little-buddha)**
*Note: Currently unavailable to stream from most major sources, so we may have to switch to an alternate.*

We also see Keanu with messianic imagery in [The Matrix](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-matrix), perhaps the strongest alternative to *Point Break* as most capturing Keanu's oeuvre. [Constantine](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/constantine) also has many religious themes.


**Weekend 3 (May 15): Highly-trained killer that questions the rules / code**


**Movie: [John Wick: Chapter 2](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/john-wick-chapter-two)**

Johnny Utah has a shot at Bodhid, but doesn't take it. Has he gotten too close? Where do (or should) his allegiances lie? In John Wick: Chapter 2, we find a similarly-conflicted Keanu, facing conflict between his sense of right and wrong, a blood oath, and a universe that doesn't always make sense (both figuratively and literally). [Is Keanu really the good guy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU)

Questioning the code is also a central to The Matrix.


**Midweek 3: So Bad It's Good Keanu**

Clearly, *Point Break* doesn't fall into this category, but there are some films that would fit this criteria. This year, we'll feature Keanu's worst-rated movie (by a hair) on Rotten Tomatoes (0%) and Metacritic (11):

**Movie: [Replicas](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/replicas)**

(Other films in this category are highly subjective)

**Weekend 4 (May 22): Actually-kinda-shitty-romantic-partner Keanu**

Keanu is really not a great partner to Tyler. Yeah, he rescues her at the end, but he used her to get to Bodhi and lied about his parents dying. Not cool! Keanu also plays a horrible partner in:


**Movie: [Destination Wedding](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/destination-wedding-2018)**

Though he does save Winona Ryder from a mountain lion (Dracula flashback!)

Bonus:
1. [A Walk in the Clouds](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/a-walk-in-the-clouds) -- dude, you're married, even if you're just trying to be nice, you can't go around pretending to be someone else's husband. you didn't know at the time that your wife was cheating on you.
2. [My Own Private Idaho](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/my-own-private-idaho) -- you knew River Phoenix was into you!
3. [Sweet November](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/sweet-november-2001) -- I haven't actually seen this but from the description it maybe fits?

**Midweek 4: Connecting with Asian Roots Keanu**

While Bodhi certainly tries to take a page from Buddhism, it still feels very Western. And despite holding his own in hand-to-hand combat with Warchild, Keanu's fighting expertise in *Point Break* is primarily firearms, not martial arts. We take a deeper dive into this with Keanu's directorial debut (also something he did not do in *Point Break*),

**Movie: [Man of Tai Chi](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/man-of-tai-chi)**



**Weekend 5: The Grandaddy of them all -- Point Break**

Everything that we have been building towards. We'll see if we can arrange an earlier start for broader participation.


**Other themes**

The following couldn't be covered this year, but remain relevant when thinking about the broader strokes of Keanu's career:
1. Bill and Ted Keanu
2. Animated Keanu (A Scanner Darkly, Toy Story 4, Cyberpunk (sortof))
3. Sci-Fi Keanu more broadly (many)
4. Cop Keanu (Speed, Street Kings)
