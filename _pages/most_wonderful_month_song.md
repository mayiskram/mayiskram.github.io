Lyrics
-------

It’s the most wonderful month of the year

With the waves out there swelling

And everyone telling you “Confront your fear”

It’s the most wonderful month of the year



It’s Pat-Patrick Swayze and Utah

Finding the source, sharing a lover of course

And gettin' radical, brah!

It’s Pat-Patrick Swayze and Utah



There’ll be waves for riding

And planes for skydiving

And sex out on the sand

There’ll be deception – how juicy!

And Gary Busey

And no coming back to the land



It’s the most wonderful month of the year

The bullets are flying and people are dying

So drink your beer!

It’s the most wonderful month, it’s the most wonderful month, it’s the most wonderful month of the year!
